# Data_Professional_Survey_Breakdown
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive Data Professional Survey analysis and visualized the results in a Power BI dashboard. The aim was to provide key insights into data professionals' preferences, challenges, and demographics, and to explore relationships between variables, including salary, job titles, gender, programming languages, and work-life balance.

## Key Visualizations:
### Country Distribution: 
Interactive dashboard showcasing the geographic distribution of survey takers.
### Average Salary by Job Title: 
Bar chart visualizing the average salaries based on different job titles.
### Difficulty to Break into Data: 
Comparative visualization displays the Difficulty faced by each data professional to break into data.
### Favorite Programming Language: 
It includes the distribution of preferred programming languages among data professionals.
### Work-Life Balance Satisfaction: 
Percentage Breakdown of data professionals satisfied with their work-life balance.
